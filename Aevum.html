            <h1>Welcome to Aevum.</h1>
            <h3>You made it! Grab a virtual seat.</h3>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;We're so glad you're here. Whether you've been planning this shoot for years or you just fell
                down an internet
                rabbit hole and landed on our page—you belong here.</p>

            <p><strong><i>&emsp;&emsp;Aevum</i></strong> isn't just a photography studio; it's a little slice of time we
                get
                to share with you. Rooted in the Latin
                word for eternity, we built this space for the dreamers, the doers, the lovers, and the legendarily
                awkward-in-front-of-cameras.</p>
            <h4><i>So, who are you?</i></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you an artist needing killer editorial portraits?</li><br>
                <li>A family wanting to finally get that holiday card right?</li><br>
                <li>Someone who just achieved something massive and wants to remember how it feels?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Whoever you are, we approach every single click of the shutter with intention and
            craftsmanship.
            No stiff poses.
            No cookie-cutter edits. Just real moments, frozen in time, built to outlast us.</p>
            <p><strong>Scroll down, take a look around, and let's make something you'll want to look at
                    forever.</strong>

        <h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1>
        <h2>We're in the business of "Forever."</h2>
        <h4>But we promise we don't take ourselves too seriously.</h4>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The name Aevum comes from the Latin word for age or eternity. It's a big concept, we know.
            But to
            us, it simply means this: What you feel right now matters, and we want you to feel it again decades from
            now.
            We are a team of visual storytellers, professional laughers, and light-chasers. We believe that a
            photograph
            shouldn't just look good—it should feel like something. That's why we ditch the rigid poses and focus on
            connection. Whether we're shooting a high-fashion editorial portrait or capturing the chaos of a
            birthday
            party, we treat every frame like a piece of art.</p>

        <h4><i>Our promise to you:</i></h4>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;We will work hard. We will make you laugh (even if you groan at our puns). And we will deliver
            photographs that don't just capture a moment, but capture you.</p>
